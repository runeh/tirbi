## To do

- [ ] Make the other methods on storage allowed to return promises

- [ ] Use custom errors when throwing?
- [ ] Allow multiple tokens?
- [ ] Add non-http logging?
- [ ] Trace IDs?
- [ ] Handle the "events" request?

- [ ] Check for permissions when using gcp
- [ ] Check for directory existence / create dir when using fs
